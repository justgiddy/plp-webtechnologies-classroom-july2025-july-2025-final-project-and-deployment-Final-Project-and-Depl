# Project README — MySite (Multipage Demo)

This repository contains a small multipage website scaffold built for the final assignment.

## Purpose

A lightweight, responsive multipage site (Home, About, Services, Contact) intended as a deployable starting point for portfolios or product landing pages.

## Structure

- index.html — Home page
- about.html — About / purpose
- services.html — Services overview
- contact.html — Contact form (includes client-side validation)
- css/styles.css — Main stylesheet
- js/main.js — Small JavaScript utilities (nav toggle, form validation)

## How to use

1. Deploy using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. (Leave deployment to you — this README is a placeholder to fill with your chosen URL.)

## Notes

- The contact form is validated on the client side only (demo). Hook it to a server or form service when deploying.
- Files are intentionally minimal and self-contained.

Replace this file's content with your final project description, screenshots, and the live site URL after deployment.
